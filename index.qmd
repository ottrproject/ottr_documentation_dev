#### Benefits for all OTTR options:

- No software installations needed
- Automatically preview content on [GitHub](https://github.com/) before you publish
- Automatically check spelling (and customize it!)
- Automatically and periodically check for broken links
- Easily customize branding
- Easily include code (and avoid version difference issues using Docker containers)

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.alt= "OTTR helps build github based websites with less hassle. Catch potential mistakes before they go live", echo = FALSE, out.width= "40%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./resources/images/why-ottr.png")
```

#### Benefits for specific uses:

- Websites can be created using [quarto](https://quarto.org/) or [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/)
- Courses can be easily formatted for learning platforms like [coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) and [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/) (only edit once and it gets propagated to all locations - making for **easy updates**!)
- Metrics can be gathered from a variety of sources for dashboards

(*Note that you will need to establish a publishing contract with coursera if you want to publish there)
